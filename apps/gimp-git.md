# GIMP-GIT

 GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a cross-platform image editor.

 This is the unofficial AppImage built on top of JuNest, the lightweight  Arch Linux based distro that runs on top of any other Linux distro.
 
 GIMP "GIT" is built from source using the AUR package "gimp-git". 
 
 Every feature, even experimental, comes from source code, which may  cause instability.
