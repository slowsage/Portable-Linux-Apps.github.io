# KBLACKBOX

 A game of hide and seek. Use lasers and markers to guess the location of  hidden atoms in the box.
 
 This script installs the full and updatable KDE Games suite from JuNest, a lightweight Arch Linux based distribution that allows the creation of disposable and partially isolated GNU/Linux environments within any generic GNU/Linux host OS and without requiring root privileges to install packages.
 
 USAGE (from the command line):
 
           kdegames -h (shows the list of games)
           kdegames $GAME (launches the selected game)
