# PICMI

 Picmi is a single player logic-based puzzle game. The goal is to color cells according to numbers given at the side of the board in order to uncover a  hidden pattern or picture.
 
 This script installs the full and updatable KDE Games suite from JuNest, a lightweight Arch Linux based distribution that allows the creation of disposable and partially isolated GNU/Linux environments within any generic GNU/Linux host OS and without requiring root privileges to install packages.
 
 USAGE (from the command line):
 
           kdegames -h (shows the list of games)
           kdegames $GAME (launches the selected game)
