# GAMEIMAGE

 AppImage Game Packer.
 
 Game emulation is on the rise, with years of contribution from the community and now with Valve's portable handheld, the steam deck. The fragmentation with several platform emulators is daunting, especially since it requires  repetitive configuration for the first time or if the config files go missing.
 
 GameImage is a tool to pack a runner (such as an emulator), a game, and it's configs in a single appimage package.
 
 Advantages:
 
 - Simplicity, no need to install an emulator or wine to run your games, they are downloaded as appimages and packaged with the game.
 - Each game config/saves are in the same folder as the appimage by default  (it can be changed to use global ~/.config). Which simplifies backups.
 - Usability, get your game running with a double click on a fresh linux  install, no dependencies required.
 - Storage, Smaller file sizes than loose files, since appimage uses squashfs.
