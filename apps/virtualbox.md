# VIRTUALBOX

 VirtualBox is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use. Not only is VirtualBox an extremely feature rich, high performance product for enterprise customers, it is also the only professional solution that is freely available as Open Source Software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3.
 
 VirtualBox is a community effort backed by a dedicated company: everyone is encouraged to contribute while Oracle ensures the product always meets professional quality criteria.
 
 This script provides the Unofficial "Archimage" (AppImage built on top of an Arch Linux container).
 
 It is based on VirtualBox KVM, not to depend on the "vboxdrv" driver.
