# ARTIFACT
 
 As chief artificer Larry Lodestone, your goal is to make your way through the intricate designs of The Artifact. Your goal is to shut down the core, which has gone haywire. However, the way in is filled with obstacles, as weird orbs spawned by the malfunctioning core are disrupting and reconstructing the matrix of The Artifact.
 Before you can reach the core, these orbs must be isolated to prevent further damage.

 In Artifact, your goal is to make your way through 40 levels of mayhem without getting destroyed, racking up as many points as possible on the way. Each level consists of a screen filled with a variety of different orbs. These orbs must be isolated by the player. Once 75% of the playing field has been isolated, the level ends, and the player moves on to the score and powerup allocation screen. The player controls the dual-direction Welding Blaster that can be rotated to fire vertically or horizontally.
 When fired, a welding beam will slowly traverse the screen in 2  directions. Once both ends reach a wall, the playing field will  be cut, isolating balls on each side of the beam. However, care must be taken not to hit the orbs, as they will create a feedback surge, damaging the Welding Blaster. Once the Welding Blaster reaches critical damage, it will explode, and the game will be over. For every level a number of new orbs will be added to the game. These can be of any type depending on the level.
