# VLC+

 VLC is a free and open source cross-platform multimedia player and framework that plays most multimedia files as  well as DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and  various streaming  protocols. 
 
 This is the unofficial AppImage built on top of JuNest, the lightweight  Arch Linux based distro that runs on top of any other Linux distro. This kind of AppImage runs on any GNU/Linux distro old or newer, with at least the  Linux kernel 3+.

 VLC+ is the stable version but with additional and/or experimental features.
 
 Support for JAVA (jre8-openjdk package) is included and is open to new feature implementations (for example, third-party plugins).
