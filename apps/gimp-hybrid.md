# GIMP-HYBRID

 GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a cross-platform image editor.

 This is the unofficial AppImage built on top of JuNest, the lightweight  Arch Linux based distro that runs on top of any other Linux distro.
 
 GIMP "Hybrid" is based on GIMP "Stable" (see "gimp"), but includes  extra libraries and third-party plugins and suport for the old Python2.
 
 If you are a GIMP fanatic, you can rely on this build, alternatively rely on the official Flatpak which already has everything you are  looking for.

 "Hybrid" Is still a work in progress. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
