# LDVIEW
 
 LDView is a real-time 3D viewer for displaying LDraw models using  hardware-accellerated 3D graphics. For information on LDraw, please  visit www.ldraw.org, the centralized LDraw information site.
 
 The program can read LDraw LDR/DAT files as well as MPD files. It  then allows you to rotate the model around to any angle with the mouse.
