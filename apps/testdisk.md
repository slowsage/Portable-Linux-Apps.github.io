# TESTDISK

 This installation script provides TestDisk & PhotoRec.
 
 TestDisk is powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed  to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again  when these symptoms are caused by faulty software: certain types of viruses  or human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table). Partition  table recovery using TestDisk is really easy. TestDisk can:
 - Fix partition table, recover deleted partition
 - Recover FAT32 boot sector from its backup
 - Rebuild FAT12/FAT16/FAT32 boot sector
 - Fix FAT tables
 - Rebuild NTFS boot sector
 - Recover NTFS boot sector from its backup
 - Fix MFT using MFT mirror
 - Locate ext2/ext3/ext4 Backup SuperBlock
 - Undelete files from FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ext2 filesystem
 - Copy files from deleted FAT, exFAT, NTFS and ext2/ext3/ext4 partitions.

 PhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files  including video, documents and archives from hard disks (Mechanical Hard  drives, Solid State Drives...), CD-ROMs, and lost pictures (thus the Photo  Recovery name) from digital camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the file system  and goes after the underlying data, so it will still work even if your  media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.
