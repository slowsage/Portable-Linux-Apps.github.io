# WINE-STABLE

 WINE - Compatibility layer to run MS Windows apps and games on GNU/Linux.
 
 "Stable" is the current stable wine version (recommended). This version is for both x86 and x64 MS Windows programs.
 
 USAGE: wine-stable winecfg (this will launch WINE Config)
        wine-stable uninstaller (this will launch Install/remove)
        wine-stable notepad (this will launch Notepad)
        wine-stable <program>.exe (to launch a any Windows program)
        
 NOTE that Q4wine and other profile managers for WINE may not recognize  this command, to solve this problem AM automatically creates a symbolic  link to this AppImage called /opt/wine-stable/wine which can be used by  the above profile managers.
 
 The "mmtrt" repository always provides the latest version for each of the  three development branches of WINE.
