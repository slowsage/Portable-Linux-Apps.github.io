# LEVIOR

 levior (latin word meaning lighter) is a web (HTTP/HTTPs) to Gemini proxy.
 
 It converts web pages on-the-fly to the gemtext format, allowing you to browse  regular web pages with any Gemini browser without having to suffer the  heavyness associated with certain technologies of the modern web.
 
 levior can either run as a gemini server with special "endpoints" that will render the requested web page as gemtext and rewrite gemini URLs to be routed through the levior service (this mode will work with all gemini  browsers), or as a transparent http proxy that renders the web pages as  gemtext without rewriting URLs (in this mode you will need to use a Gemini  browser that supports using proxies).
