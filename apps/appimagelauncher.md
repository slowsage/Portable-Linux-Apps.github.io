# APPIMAGELAUNCHER

 AppImageLauncher is a helper application for Linux distributions  serving as a kind of "entry point" for running and integrating  AppImages. AppImageLauncher plays well with other applications managing  AppImages, for example app stores. However, it doesn't depend on  any of those, and can run completely standalone.
 
 This script provides the command line version.
 USAGE: appimagelauncher --help
 
 NOTE, use the following command to open the graphical Settings  Manager of AppImageLauncher:
 
         "appimagelauncher AppImageLauncherSettings"
         
 and set a different path for your AppImages, as the default one
 is ~/Applications, while other tools managed by "AM" and AppMan
 can use different paths (for example "appimagedl").
