# CRITERIA-GEO

 CRITERIA 1D is a one-dimensional agro-hydrological model. It includes soil  water fluxes, crop development and water needs, a GIS interface (CRITERIA  GEO) for geographical simulations and tools to manage crop and soil  parameters. 
 
 The software is written in C++ using Qt libraries, so cross-platform  building is possible (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
 
 CRITERIA-GEO is a GIS interface for managing geographical input/output of  CRITERIA-1D model: crop map, soil map, meteorological grid and computation  units map. A computation unit is defined as a different combination of crop, soil and meteo data.
