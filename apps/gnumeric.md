# GNUMERIC

 Gnumeric is an open-source spreadsheet program. Gnumeric and its source  code are available free of charge, licensed under the terms of the GNU  General Public License version 2 or version 3.
 
 Gnumeric starts up quickly and handles large spreadsheets while remaining responsive. A spreadsheet should calculate the right answer. Gnumeric's  built-in functions and tools are accurate as several, researchers, have  found.
 
 This is the unofficial AppImage built on top of JuNest, the lightweight  Arch Linux based distro that runs on top of any other Linux distro.
