# THUNDERBIRD-BETA

 Thunderbird is an mail client suitable for free distribution.
 The goal of Thunderbird is to produce a cross platform stand-alone  mail application using the XUL user interface language. It supports  different mail accounts, no matter of the used protocol like POP(s)  or IMAP(s), has an integrated learning Spam filter, and offers easy  organization of mails with tagging and virtual folders. Also, more  features can be added by installing extensions.
 Thunderbird also includes an integrated calendar for handling events, events invitations and tasks in multiple calendars. It supports local  calendars, CalDAV and plain ics files on CardDAV and WebDAV.
  
 This is the official BETA build with automatic updates.
