# KSNAKEDUEL

 Snake race game. The object of the game is to avoid running into walls, your own tail, and that of your opponent, while at the same time you have to try  to get your opponent to run into them.
 
 It also includes kdesnake, a special mode of the game where you can play the  classical snake action game. In snake you steer a snake which has to eat food. While eating, the snake grows. But once a player collides with the other  snake or  the wall, the game is lost. This becomes, of course, more and more difficult the longer the snakes grow.
 
 This script installs the full and updatable KDE Games suite from JuNest, a lightweight Arch Linux based distribution that allows the creation of  disposable and partially isolated GNU/Linux environments within any generic  GNU/Linux host OS and without requiring root privileges to install packages.
 
 USAGE (from the command line):
 
           kdegames -h (shows the list of games)
           kdegames $GAME (launches the selected game)
