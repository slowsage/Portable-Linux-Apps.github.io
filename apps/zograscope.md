# ZOGRASCOPE

 Zograscope is mainly a syntax-aware diff that also provides a number of additional tools. 
 
 The nature of syntax-aware diff requires knowledge of structure of the code, which can be used to build other simple tools that  can benefit from this information. Competing with real language  front-ends in the level of accuracy is not possible, but making  some things that are one step further than regular  text-processing utilities seems feasible and the result might be  even more practical than some of the more elaborate tools which  end up requiring complicated setup process.
 
 The project is work in progress, but is useful in its current  state.
