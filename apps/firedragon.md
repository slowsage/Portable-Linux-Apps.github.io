# FIREDRAGON

 FireDragon is a browser based on the excellent Floorp browser (also called the Vivaldi of Firefox's).
 
 It was customized to have dr460nized-fitting aestetics as well as many opiniated settings by default.
 
 As this browser was originally a Librewolf fork, we are trying to integrate its best patches and tweaks in the new base.
 
 The most important features in addition of Floorps own ones can be found below.

 - Searx & Whoogle search engines added, with the possibility to run locally if fitting deps are installed
 - The default search engine is Garuda's SearxNG instance
 - Dark Reader
 - Sweet theme added
 - Custom, dr460nized branding üêâ
 - Keeps privacy-enhancing settings in sync with Librewolfs changes
 - Firefox accounts are enabled and profile data is synced to a custom self-hosted sync server (ffsync.garudalinux.org)
 - Presets for both profile-sync-daemon (which Garuda Linux ships by default) & Firejail are available
 - Faster webpages loading from:
    - Custom Firedragon settings
    - Inclusion of FastFox tweaks
 - Hidden Navigation buttons instead of being greyed out when they are inactive
 - PBMode Security
 - Latest Fingerprinting as an option in firedragon.cfg (you can copy to your own firedragon.overrides.cfg and enable there)
