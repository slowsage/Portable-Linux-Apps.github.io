# CRITERIA1D-PRO

 CRITERIA 1D is a one-dimensional agro-hydrological model. It includes soil  water fluxes, crop development and water needs, a GIS interface (CRITERIA  GEO) for geographical simulations and tools to manage crop and soil  parameters. 
 
 The software is written in C++ using Qt libraries, so cross-platform  building is possible (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
 
 CRITERIA1D_PRO is a graphical interface to manage a Criteria-1D project,  modify the crop parameters, test the model and the main outputs: leaf area  index, evaporation and transpiration, root depth and root density, soil  moisture and irrigation water needs.
