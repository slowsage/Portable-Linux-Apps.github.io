# ARCHIMAGE-CLI
 
 ArchImage is the bundling of Arch Linux packages into an AppImage using JuNest.
 
 This allows you to use the latest programs from Arch Linux and AUR on every  distribution, old or newer.
 
 In the past AppImages were built using .deb packages or guessing instructions  to make them work. With the "ArchImage" method all you have to do is the  reverse, i.e. "delete" what is no longer needed.
 
 Among the advantages, we have:
 - compatibility with all versions of Linux starting from kernel 2.6, therefore  also older distributions than those normally indicated by the classic AppImage  developers;
 - easy and immediate compilation;
 - AppRun script very minimal and easy to configure;
 - all programs for Arch Linux within AppImage's reach, therefore one of the  most extensive software parks in the GNU/Linux panorama.
 
 This tool is a part of "AM" and AppMan and many AppImages built to complete this collection (like obs-studio, mpv, abiword and handbrake) are built using this solution.
