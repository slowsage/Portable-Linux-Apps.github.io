# SIMPLE-S3-UPLOADER

 simple-uploader is a tool for easily uploading files and sharing links via AWS S3. The user enters their bucket name and credentials, then they can easily drop in files to be uploaded and are given a link to share that file with others. They can also delete files that they have uploaded from that device.
