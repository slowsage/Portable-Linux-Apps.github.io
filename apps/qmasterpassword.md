# QMASTERPASSWORD

 qMasterPassword is a password manager based on Qt. Access all your  passwords using only a single master password. But in contrast to  other managers it does not store any passwords: Unique passwords  are generated from the master password and a site name. 
 
 This means you automatically get different passwords for each  account and there is no password file that can be lost or get  stolen. There is also no need to trust any online password  service.
