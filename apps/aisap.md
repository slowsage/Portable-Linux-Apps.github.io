# AISAP
 
 AppImage SAndboxing Project (pronounced /eɪsæp/): a Go library  to help sandbox AppImages through bwrap.
 VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT! Many parts of this are subject to change  and should be expected to until it reaches a more stable form.
 
 aisap intends to be a simple way to implement Android/Flatpak  style sandboxing with AppImages. It has a profile system, but it  intends to keep it as basic as possible, making it easier to  understand what a program actually requires to run without  dealing with the hassle of individually cherry-picking files.
 
 It currently has a basic re-implementaion of the go-appimage API, so modifying existing GoLang programs to include sandboxing  should be fairly painless.
 
 USAGE: `aisap $APPIMAGE`
