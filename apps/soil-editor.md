# SOIL-EDITOR

 CRITERIA 1D is a one-dimensional agro-hydrological model. It includes soil  water fluxes, crop development and water needs, a GIS interface (CRITERIA  GEO) for geographical simulations and tools to manage crop and soil  parameters. 
 
 The software is written in C++ using Qt libraries, so cross-platform  building is possible (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
 
 Soil editor is a tool to edit the soil properties. It uses a modified Van  Genuchten - Mualem model to estimate the water retention and hydraulic c onductivity curves.
