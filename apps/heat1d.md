# HEAT1D

 CRITERIA 1D is a one-dimensional agro-hydrological model. It includes soil  water fluxes, crop development and water needs, a GIS interface (CRITERIA  GEO) for geographical simulations and tools to manage crop and soil  parameters. 
 
 The software is written in C++ using Qt libraries, so cross-platform  building is possible (Windows, Linux, MacOS).
 
 HEAT1D is a graphical interface for testing the soilFluxex3D library in a  1D domain. Users can set fixed or variable atmospheric boundary conditions  and soil parameters. Output graph results include soil temperature, soil  water content, heat fluxes (diffusive and latent), liquid (isothermal and  thermal) and vapor (isothermal and thermal) water fluxes.
