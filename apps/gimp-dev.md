# GIMP-DEV

 GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program) is a cross-platform image editor.

 This is the unofficial AppImage built on top of JuNest, the lightweight  Arch Linux based distro that runs on top of any other Linux distro.
 
 GIMP "Dev" is the upcoming version with all latest features and port to the more recent technologies.
 
 To build this AppImage I've used the package "gimp-devel" from the Arch User Repository "AUR".
