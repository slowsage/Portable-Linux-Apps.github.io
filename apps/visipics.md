# VISIPICS

 VisiPics is a software for Windows PCs designed specifically to find and remove duplicate pictures. It can be a handy tool if you have a large collection of photos and suspect there might be a lot of redundancy. Here’s a breakdown of what VisiPics does:

 - Finds duplicates: VisiPics employs various image comparison techniques to identify duplicate photos on your hard drive. It can find exact matches and even similar images with slight modifications.
 - Multiple filters: The software offers several filters that allow you to adjust the search criteria for finding duplicates, giving you more control over the process.
 - Safe deletion: VisiPics sends duplicate images to the recycle bin by default, ensuring you can recover them accidentally if needed. It’s recommended to review the identified duplicates before permanent deletion.
 - Fast processing: VisiPics is known for its speed compared to other duplicate finder programs. You can continue using your computer while it scans your photos in the background.

 However, it’s important to note that VisiPics only works with pictures and isn’t designed to find duplicate files of other formats like documents or videos. Also, the latest version was released in 2013, so there might be more feature-rich options available.

 This is the Unofficial AppImage built with "wine32-deploy" and powered by "wine".

 NOTE: being a software to be executed manually through "wine" during the assembly, this AppImage package has been manually uploaded among the releases of the repository indicated below, and not automatically through github actions, so the code for the compilation is not available except through the guide for "wine32-deploy", with which you can compile it yourself, in the same way, following the instructions.

 As an author, I recommend using "czkawka" instead of "visipics".
