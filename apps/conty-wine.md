# CONTY-WINE

 This is an easy to use compressed unprivileged Linux container packed  into a single executable that works on most Linux distros. It is  designed to be as simple and user-friendly as possible. You can use  it to run any applications, including games (Vulkan and OpenGL).
 
 In its default release, it includes, among others, these apps: Wine-GE, Steam, Lutris, PlayOnLinux, GameHub, Minigalaxy, Legendary, Bottles,  MultiMC, MangoHud, Gamescope, RetroArch, PPSSPP, PCSX2, DuckStation,  OBS Studio, OpenJDK, Firefox.
 
 This release contains only Wine and its dependencies. Note that the  other Conty versions include Wine too, but if you only need Wine and  nothing else, you can use this Conty version, it takes up less disk  space than the others.
